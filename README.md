# React Camera Demo
Processing to allow a React Native app to take a picture with the devices camera and display the image back to the user.

The original work on this repos was based on [this blog post](https://medium.com/@nutanbhogendrasharma/implement-camera-in-react-native-mobile-app-part-1-ea307ce924a4) for which I am grateful.
